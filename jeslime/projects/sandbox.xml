	     Writers are used to specify the kinds of output that should be
	     created during the simulation. This is the raw output; visualizations
	     are handled in their own section. Note that visualizations often
	     have prerequisites.
	     
	     State is only captured in the frames specified by the "output-frames"
	     tag. This will eventually be modified to specify frames by either
	     simulation time (t) or cycle number (n).

		    This writer creates a FASTA-like vector representation of the system
		    state. This includes the phenotype of each cell, the fitness, and so
		    on. It also writes an index file that specifies the mapping between
		    vector index and coordinate value. Finally, it records information
		    about global extrema, such as the minimum and
		    maximum of each solute field, as well as minimum and maximum fitnesses.
		    This is used for setting the scale of some visualizations.
